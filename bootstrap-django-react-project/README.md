# bootstrap-django-react-project

Open a terminal and `cd` to this directory. Run

```bash
$> python new_django_react.py [name_of_project] -l [path_to_project_directory]
```

Project will be created in this directory if the `-l`/`--location` argument is not provided. Make sure to specify the location to avoid issues with `pipenv`.

**NOTE**: Script was created and tested on Windows, but should work just fine on Linux.
