# bootstrap-django-react-project

Open a terminal and `cd` to this directory. Run

```bash
$> python new_django_react.py [name_of_project]
```

Project will be created in this directory. After the script finishes, you can move the project folder to wherever you want.

**Note**: Tested only on Windows. This script makes extensive use of the `subprocess` library and was written on a Windows machine, and thus, uses Windows-specific commands.
